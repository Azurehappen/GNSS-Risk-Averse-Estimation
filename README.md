# Optimization-Based Risk-Averse State Estimation for GNSS outlier accommodation in the urban environment

Current targeted signal:
GPS: L1
GLO:
GAL:
BDS: B1I (Before customizing the satellite position calculation, please read BDS ICD; different signal channels may have different computations.)

This repo is for the experiment of the PhD dissertation and DGNSS Risk-Aver paper. More information will be added later.
